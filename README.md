# Advent of Code 2021

Link of the challenge : https://adventofcode.com/

## Organisation

Since we will be several at doing challenge, I propose we use the following code structure.
At the top-level, we will have a folder for each day : `01`, `02`, ...
For each day repo, there will be one folder for each user doing the challenge. You could use your github handle or any name that you choose.

In this folder, you are free to do whatever you want to do !
